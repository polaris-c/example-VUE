    Abstract<br>
    ************<br>
    This paper addresses the problem of generating possible object lo-cations for use in object recognition. <br>
    We introduce Selective Search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and seg-mentation. <br>
    Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations.<br> Instead of a single technique to gen-erate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. <br>
    Our Selective Search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99% recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. <br>
    The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. <br>
        In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. <br>
    The Selective Search software is made publicly available 1.<br>
    Introduction<br>
    For a long time, objects were sought to be delineated before their

    identification. <br>
    ************<br>
    This gave rise to segmentation, which aims for a unique partitioning of the image through a generic algorithm, where there is one part for all object silhouettes in the image. <br>
    Re-search on this topic has yielded tremendous progress over the past years [3, 6, 13, 26]. <br>
    But images are intrinsically hierarchical: In Figure 1a the salad and spoons are inside the salad bowl, which in turn stands on the table. <br>
    Furthermore, depending on the context the term table in this picture can refer to only the wood or include ev-erything on the table. <br>
    Therefore both the nature of images and the different uses of an object category are hierarchical. <br>
    This prohibits the unique partitioning of objects for all but the most specific pur-poses. <br>
    Hence for most tasks multiple scales in a segmentation are a necessity. <br>
    This is most naturally addressed by using a hierarchical partitioning, as done for example by Arbelaez et al. [3].
